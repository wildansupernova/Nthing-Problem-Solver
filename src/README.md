To execute this program you need:
1. Computer with standard RAM
2. Python3 installed
3. File containing your pawns configuration with this pattern:
   <pawn_color> <pawn_type> <number_of_pawn>
   Pawn color = {"WHITE", "BLACK"}
   Pawn type = {"ROOK", "BISHOP", "QUEEN", "KNIGHT"}
   Number of pawn = integer, with constraint: the total number of pawns is not greater than 64
   (max(total_number_of_pawn) <= 64)
   At least you need one pawn to use this program, just make sure the file is not empty.

How to use this N-ything Problem Solver
1. Make sure you have Python3 installed on your computer/laptop
2. Make sure you have set your Python3 as an environment variables correctly
3. Open the folder containing the source cod
4. Open terminal on that folder
5. Type "py Main.py"
6. The program would ask for your file name. Don't forget to type the path if it is not in the path with the code
7. If your file is correctly written, the program would ask you to choose an algorithm.
   Type "1" for Hill Climbing,
   Type "2" for Simulated Annealing, or
   Type "3" for Genetic Algorithm.
8. For Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm, you would be given choice if you want to edit the configuration or not.
   Type "1" to edit the configuration, or
   Type "2" to use the default configuration.
9. Last but not least, please wait until the program shows the best solution it could get.

Thank you for using this program.
